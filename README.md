# BMI Calculator

This BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator is a simple Python application developed as part of my internship at [Go2Cod](https://go2cod.com.et/). 
It uses the Tkinter library to create a graphical interface where users can input their weight and height to calculate their BMI.

## Features

* User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter
* Allows users to input weight and height in metric units (kg and meters)
* Calculates BMI based on user input
* Displays BMI result along with a category label (e.g., Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obese)

## Technologies Used

* Python: Main programming language
* Tkinter: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI)
